## Introduction

Decentralized Voting Platform is a secure and transparent blockchain-based system that enables anonymous and tamper-proof voting. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, the platform ensures that all votes are immutably recorded and verifiable, making it ideal for any voting scenario where trust and transparency are paramount.

## Features

- Secure Voting Mechanism

  Voters can securely cast their votes using Ethereum-based smart contracts, ensuring that all votes are tamper-proof and verifiable on the blockchain.

- Anonymous Voting

  The system allows for anonymous voting, ensuring voter privacy while still maintaining the integrity of the vote count.

- Real-Time Vote Counting

  Votes are counted in real-time, and results are updated automatically as new votes are cast, providing transparency and immediate insights into the voting process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or above): Required to run the development server and install dependencies.
- **npm** (v6.x or above) or **yarn**: For managing dependencies.
- **Truffle** (v5.x): For compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **Ganache** (or another Ethereum client): For running a local blockchain for development.
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with the dApp.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/actopas/de_vote.git
cd de_vote
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you use Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

3.**Install Truffle globally (if not already installed):**

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

4.**Start Ganache:**

If you have Ganache installed, start it. It will simulate a local Ethereum blockchain. Ensure it’s running on the default port (7545).

5.**Compile and migrate the smart contracts:**

```bash
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

6.**Run tests:**

To make sure everything is working, run the tests provided in the project:

```bash
truffle test
```

7.**Start the React development server:**

```bash
npm start
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.

## Usage

Explain how to use the application once it's running. Include screenshots if possible.

Example:

- Connect MetaMask to your local blockchain (Ganache) using the provided mnemonic.
- Navigate to the application in your browser.
- Interact with the smart contract through the provided UI (e.g., create a new vote, view results, etc.).
